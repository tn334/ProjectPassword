## 3. Interviews summary

### Interview 1

**Interviewer:** Levi Watlington\
**Interviewee:** Ronald Riddle\
**When:** 02/09/2023

**Customer segments:** I chose this person to interview because I wanted to see how someone around my age would react to these questions and our product.

**Key insights:**

- We should have the user recalibrate every few months so the type style reading stays accurate.

**Representative quotes:**

- “The concept sounds pretty sick”

**Assessment:**

- Simple user interface (Nice to have)

### Interview 2

**Interviewer:** Levi Watlington\
**Interviewee:** Deborah Stanley\
**When:** 02/10/2023

**Customer segments:** I chose this person to interview because they are older and would have a different view of technology.

**Key insights:**

- Older people may have a harder time remembering passwords, so they are more likely to have less passwords than the average person which is dangerous.

**Representative quotes:**

- "That sounds really cool"

**Assessment:**

- Uncomplicated user experience (Nice to have)

### Interview 3

**Interviewer:** Taylor Nielsen\
**Interviewee:** Shawna Nielsen\
**When:** 9:30 AM on 02/10/2023

**Customer segments:** I choose to interview this customer because they represent someone who has very limited knowledge around technology. They use technology every day but severely struggle to manage most aspects of organization and navigation when it comes to electronics and accounts.

**Key insights:**

- Interviewee has very little understanding surrounding password set ups and management. Selects the hardest password suggested by apple products but has not set up password management across devices and can not replicate the password. Must use dedicated device associated with setting up the password. Interviewee trusts finger print log in and understands that our system would also use a type of biometric evaluation. Thinks it would be much easier to use than typical password log in systems
- Participant did not fully understand question about account password requirements.

**Representative quotes:**

- "I just choose the hardest password but then I can't even find half the keys it uses to replicate it. I can only get into my accounts on the ipad."

**Assessment:**

- Convenient security solution (Nice to have)

### Interview 4

**Interviewer:** Taylor Nielsen\
**Interviewee:** Ryder Desalvo\
**When:** 5:00 PM on 02/09/2023

**Customer segments:** I chose this interviewee because they are someone that is very concerned with account security but is not heavily involved with technology.

**Key insights:**

- Interviewee does participate in finger print and facial recognition log in methods but does not trust their security levels because of stories about people using their metrics without consent when asleep. Thinks that because of the need for awareness and active participation, this would have a higher level of security.
- Participant has a system for creating passwords but does not use a password manager. Participant has a base password with derivatives/variations from that password used for different accounts.

**Representative quotes:**

- "Thats an interesting concept, I'd be interested in the consistency of it. That sounds like the computer noticing my typing as handwriting. My immediate concern would be the consistency."

**Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don’t care**
    - Consistent login method (Nice to have)

### Interview 5

**Interviewer:** Eduardo De La Rosa\
**Interviewee:** Daniel Rodriguez\
**When:** 6:30 PM on 02/09/2023

**Customer segments:** I chose this interviewee because they are someone that is tech-savvy and always looking at how they can they improve their security methods to protect their personal information online.

**Key insights:**

- Interviewee uses a password manager to store and manage their passwords. They believe having a password manager makes it easier to generate and store strong, unique passwords for each of my accounts, which is more secure than using simple, easily guessable passwords.
- Interviewee uses strong, unique passwords for all accounts, avoids using public Wi-Fi for sensitive transactions, and keeps their software and security measures up to date. Additionally, they keep an eye on their accounts for any suspicious activity and act promptly if they notice anything out of the ordinary.

**Representative quotes:**

- "I would be concerned about having one of my accounts compromised, as it could result in financial losses or the exposure of my personal information. With the increasing number of data breaches and security threats, it's important to me to take steps to protect my online accounts and information."
- "I try to be proactive and take steps to secure my accounts in order to help minimize risk."

**Assessment:**

- Secure and convenient authentication (Must have)
- Minimal user interface (Nice to have)

**Key insights:**

- Interviewee uses a password manager to store and manage their passwords whenever logging into an account. They consider using a reputable and well-reviewed password manager to ensure the security of their sensitive information is vital to being safe online.
- Interviewee feels frustrated and confused about the consistency of password requirements across different websites and services. Some websites may require a password with a minimum length, special characters, and numbers, while others may have different or less stringent requirements.

**Representative quotes:**

- "I hope for more consistent and standardized password requirements across all websites and services, as this would make it easier for individuals to follow best practices for password security and to protect their online accounts."
- "The ability to use my typing style as a method of authentication into my accounts would be a massive game changer into how I would interact with login pages."

**Representative quotes:**
- "Biometrics are useful because it's easily accessible, and you don't have to go through the effort of changing such-and-such passwords on a routine basis. That's not the case with string-based keys, because you have to constantly keep things fresh to make sure the company doesn't lose a lot of important stuff."
